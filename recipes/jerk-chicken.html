<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Jerk Chicken is probably Jamaica’s most iconic dish and this oven-baked
  version is just as flavorful as the grilled version. This is a recipe you’ll
  want to save, remake, and pass on to your children. It’s honestly that GOOD.

  <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 tsp browning</li>
  <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cooking oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
  <li>coarse salt and pepper, to taste</li>
  <li>5 scallion (green onion) stalks, chopped</li>
  <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup cilantro, stems included</li>
  <li>1/4 cup fresh thyme</li>
  <li>1 small cooking tomato</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic cloves</li>
  <li>5 all spice (pimento) seeds, dried</li>
  <li>1 medium green bell pepper</li>
  <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper, seeds removed</li>
  <li>4-6 chicken quarters (leg + thigh)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Adobo seasoning</li>
  <li>2 tbsp browning</li>
  <li>1 tbsp habanero sauce optional</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Prepare the seasonings. First, make the wet jerk marinade by combining all
    the ingredients for the marinade in a food processor and pulsing until
    combined. Set aside. Next, make the green seasoning by combining all the
    ingredients for the marinade in a food processor and pulsing until mixture
    forms a thick paste. Set aside. [NOTE: You'll have more green seasoning that
    you need for this recipe. Store any extra seasoning in the fridge, it will
    keep for about a week].
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare chicken by washing with lemon juice and removing excess skin. Season
    with adobo, habanero sauce (if you want extra spice), browning (for color),
    wet jerk marinade, and about 3 tbsp of wet green marinade. Use hands to
    ensure marinade and seasonings are evenly distributed throughout the
    chicken. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, ideally overnight.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Remove chicken from fridge and bring to room
    temperature. Bake chicken for 30-35 minutes on each side in a cast iron pan
    until skin is caramelized and chicken is fully cooked.
  </li>
  <li>Serve with additional wet marinade on top, if desired.</li>
