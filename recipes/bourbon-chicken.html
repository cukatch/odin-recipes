<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>¼ cup lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
  <li>¼ cup bourbon</li>
  <li>¼ cup unsweetened apple juice</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
  <li>
    1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips
  </li>
  <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, plus 1 teaspoon, divided</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
  <li>3 cups cooked brown rice</li>
  <li>Sliced scallions, for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Combine soy sauce, bourbon, apple juice, vinegar, maple syrup, garlic,
    ginger and crushed red pepper in a small bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Toss together chicken and 1 tablespoon cornstarch in a large bowl. Heat oil
    in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken; cook,
    stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Add
    the soy-bourbon mixture; stir to coat. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce
    has reduced to a syrupy consistency and the chicken is cooked through, 6 to
    8 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine water and the remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch in a small bowl; stir
    to mix well. Add to the pan; cook, stirring often, until the sauce thickens
    and coats the chicken, 1 to 2 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Divide rice among 4 plates; top with the chicken and sauce. Garnish with
    scallions, if desired.
  </li>
</ol>
